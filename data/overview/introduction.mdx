### Design goals

**styple** is a CSS-in-TS based design system. It focuses on three main areas: accessibility, micro-interactions, user & developer experience.

#### Accessibility

The design system follow WCAG standards as best it can (continuely improved!) via the use of [Radix-UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) base components and accessible default themes.

#### Micro-interactions

**styple** is designed in such a way as to make the web more fun to use. This is done by providing delightful micro-interactions and animation in its components. 

#### UX & DX

Good user experience is important for high-quality webapps and as such **styple** does everything it can to enable this. However, developer experience is just as important, which is why **styple** strives for a solid component API. This is enhanced by using Stitches and Radix as the design-system technology.

### More tools

**styple** is more than just a design system. It also has other useful tools for developing webapps with React. See [Getting Started](/docs/overview/getting-started) for more information about additional packages.
