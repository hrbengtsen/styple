### Design goals

**styple** is a CSS-in-TS based design system. It focuses on three main areas: accessibility, micro-interactions, user & developer experience.

#### Accessibility

The design system follow WCAG standards as best it can (continuely improved!) via the use of [Radix-UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) base components and accessible default themes.

#### Micro-interactions

The web should be more <Sparkles>fun</Sparkles> to use. As such **styple** is designed in a way that enables delightful micro-interactions and animations in its components. Though it always respects users who want reduced motion.

#### UX & DX

Good user experience is important for high-quality webapps and as such **styple** does everything it can to enable this. Developer experience is also important, which is why **styple** strives for a solid component API.

### More tools

**styple** is more than just a design system. It has other useful tools for developing webapps with React. See [Getting Started](/docs/overview/getting-started) for more information about additional packages.
