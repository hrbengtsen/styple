### Design goals

Styple focuses on three main areas: accessibility, micro-interactions, user & developer experience.

> Styple is made to be customized as its made with CSS-in-JS framework [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/). This is an opinionated choice, making the underlying styling capabilities of the design system Stitches-based.

#### Accessibility

The design system follow WCAG standards as best it can (continuely improved!) via the use of [Radix-UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) base components and accessible default themes.

#### Micro-interactions

Styple is designed in such a way as to make the web more fun to use. This is done by providing delightful micro-interactions and animation in its components. 

#### UX & DX

Good user experience is important for high-quality webapps and as such Styple does everything it can to enable this. However, developer experience is just as important, which is why Styple strives for a solid component API. This is leveled up by using aforementioned Stitches and  Radix, which aim for the same goal of great developer experience.

### More tools

Styple is more than just a design system. It also has other useful tools for developing webapps with React. See [Getting Started](/docs/overview/getting-started) for more information about additional packages.
