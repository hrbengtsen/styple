### Example

<Preview>
  <ScrollArea>
    <Container css={{
      maxWidth: "$4xl",
      height: "$lg",
      whiteSpace: "nowrap"
    }}>
      <Text>A long example line that overflows the container element, since white-space nowrap is applied. A native-like scrollbar is added through ScrollArea. It works both vertically and horizontally.</Text>
    </Container>
  </ScrollArea>
</Preview>

```tsx outline=true
import { ScrollArea } from "@styple/design-system";

<ScrollArea>
  <Container css={{
    maxWidth: "$4xl",
    height: "$lg",
    whiteSpace: "nowrap"
  }}>
    <Text>A long example line that overflows the container element, since white-space nowrap is applied. A native-like scrollbar is added through ScrollArea. It works both vertically and horizontally.</Text>
  </Container>
</ScrollArea>
```
